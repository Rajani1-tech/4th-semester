Hello everybody! It's me, Rajani Lamichhane. I am currently learning machine learning and deep learning. I would love to connect with like-minded people who share the same interests as mine.I'm presently enrolled in my second year of computer science and technology, while also fascinated by deep learning, machine learning, and statistics. I want to use technology to create beneficial tools and significant solutions.   In order to empower and learn from other women in IT, I have also been contributing to women in Big Data Nepal for the past few years. I enjoy doing research and reading books in my spare time. Depending on the situation and the other person, I can be either an introvert or an extrovert
